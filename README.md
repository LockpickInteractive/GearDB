A repository filled with Rescripted versions of roblox gears forgotten through the years
# Notice
With items like the boomboxes, most if not all of them use the exact same code, so most of them are copied from the golden boombox, which code still works.

# Setup
Currently, you must either install the [LoadLibrary.rbxmx](https://devforum.roblox.com/uploads/short-url/bSMD1kiXg4uFGtNPDnTo2PpHu1A.rbxmx) or the [Automated Setup Script](https://github.com/StarLandRBLX/GearDB/raw/main/LoadLibraryInstaller.lua) to load the proper libraries for many legacy gear assets.
